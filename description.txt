> More Signs! <

Vanilla+ furniture mod, adding brand new signs to every Vanilla furniture set to your game!
Also adds useful wooden signs to help you organize your chest rooms!

Includes translation for every supported language.
Translation files are decompiled directly from the base game then splicing together translation keys.
If there are any translation issues, please leave a comment and I'll try to correct it ASAP! ðŸ˜Š
