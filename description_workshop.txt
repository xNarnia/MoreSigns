[h1]More Signs![/h1]
This "furniture mod" adds brand new signs based on vanilla tiles to your game!
The idea is to add signs to the already existing furniture sets. I've also added useful wooden signs to help you organize your chest rooms!

Translation is important, so I've included translations for every supported language.
I do this by using translation files I decompiled directly from the base game then splicing together translation keys.
If there are any translation issues, please leave a comment and I'll try to correct it ASAP! ðŸ˜Š

This mod is open-source. You can use it to make your own signs for your mod!
