[h1]More Signs![/h1]
Decorate with brand new signs based on vanilla tiles!
Use alternate wooden signs to organize your chest rooms!

Translation is important. I've included translations for every supported language.
I use translation files I decompiled directly from the base game. Then, I splice together the translation keys.

[b]If there are any translation issues, please leave a comment and I'll try to correct it ASAP! üòä[/b]

This mod is open-source. You can use it to make your own signs for your mod!
